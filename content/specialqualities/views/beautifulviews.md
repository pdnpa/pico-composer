#	Beautiful views created by contrasting landscapes and dramatic geology

## Description of special quality

This special quality encompasses the stunning views afforded by the PDNP landscape. Particular reference is given to the contrasting nature of PDNP landscapes, with the high moorland edges of the Dark and South West Peak contrasting with the lower limestone dales and valleys of the White Peak. As well as contrasting landscapes and dramatic geology, characteristic PDNP views are also considered, such as estate lands, blanket bog and meadows.

## Overall vulnerability of special quality

This special quality is highly vulnerable to climate change. Of the 15 special quality features assessed, 13% have been rated as ‘very high’ on our scale and 73% were rated as ‘high’. The rest have been rated as ‘moderate’, and no features were given a ‘low’ rating. Extremes of drought or flooding, along with storm damage, are some of the key factors likely to affect beautiful views in the PDNP.
